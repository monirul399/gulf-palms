            "For more than a hundred years, our ties with the agricultural sector in Kuwait has been solid ever since Mr.Ibraheem Almodaf planted wheat in Failaka and Adiliya. He also planted palm trees in his lands in Basra, Iraq with a noble goal of providing food security. After Mr.Ibraheem passed away his son Jasem took over the work of his father’s land in Basra and continued for a few decades. And after Mr.Jasem passed away his sons continues the path by establishing Gulf Palm Company as a family business in the year 1991. With the experience gained from more than 3 decades in the business, today Gulf Palms is considered one of the biggest names in Kuwait for producing and importing high quality plants.following the establishment in 1991 we started the production and sale of palm trees of multiple species. Some of them were rare such as Om Aldhen, Hasawi, Bream, Fahl Alghanami. Our guarantee for high quality palms every time we make a sale earned us the valuable trust of our clients and after a short time Gulf Palm became the exclusive representative in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia for the French company Marioneh for palm production and sale.Our company has extended the range of specialties to include production and sale of Sedir and fruit trees while keeping our trademark guarantee for the quality of our production. Through the years we kept expanding the range of production and imports of all agricultural needs as well as establishing a specialized department for designing and implementing Agricultural projects and garden maintenance.",
